# ✅ Real-Time Shop Status System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 System Overview

**WebSocket-based real-time communication system** that instantly updates user panels when admin changes shop status.

### Architecture:
```
Admin Panel (approves/rejects shops)
         ↓
DatabaseManager.updateSellerAndShopStatus()
         ↓
ShopStatusWebSocketServer (port 8082)
         ↓
ShopStatusWebSocketClient (singleton)
         ↓
3 User Controllers Listen for Updates:
├── ShopsController (shops list)
├── MenuController (food items from approved shops)
└── FoodItemsController (all food items)
         ↓
UI Updates INSTANTLY (no refresh needed)
```

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### **STEP 1: Start Application**
```powershell
mvn javafx:run
```

### **STEP 2: Verify Server Startup**
**Look for in console:**
```
Creating Shop Status WebSocket Server on port 8082...
✓ Shop Status WebSocket Server started on port 8082
Shop Status WebSocket Server started successfully on port 8082
```

### **STEP 3: Login as USER (Not Admin)**
1. Login with any **non-admin user account**
2. Navigate to **Shops page** (bottom navigation)

**Console should show:**
```
ShopsController: Initializing shop status WebSocket client...
Shop Status WebSocket Client: Attempting to connect to ws://localhost:8082
✓ Shop Status WebSocket Client: Connected to server
  Connection status: CONNECTED
  Client URI: ws://localhost:8082
  Client ready state: OPEN
Shop Status WebSocket: Client connected from /127.0.0.1:XXXXX
Shop Status WebSocket: Total clients: 1

━━━ CLIENT CONNECTION DEBUG ━━━
Connected: true
URI: ws://localhost:8082
Ready State: OPEN
Listeners: 3
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ShopsController: Loading X approved shops
  - Shop Name 1 (ID: X, Status: approved)
  - Shop Name 2 (ID: Y, Status: approved)

✓ Listener added. Total listeners: 3, Connected: true
ShopsController: Shop status listener registered
```

### **STEP 4: Open Admin Panel (Separate Window)**
1. Open **NEW browser/application window**
2. Login as **admin**
3. Go to **Manage Shops** section

### **STEP 5: Test Shop Approval (Pending → Approved)**
1. In **Admin Panel**: Find a shop with **"pending"** status
2. Change dropdown to **"approved"**
3. **CRITICAL:** Click **"Details"** button (⚠️ Just changing dropdown doesn't save!)

**Expected Console Output:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ BROADCASTING SHOP STATUS CHANGE                        ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
  Shop ID:     4
  Shop Name:   Pizza Palace
  New Status:  approved
  Owner ID:    2
  JSON:        {"shopId":4,"ownerId":2,"shopName":"Pizza Palace","status":"approved","action":"status_changed"}
  Connected clients (before broadcast): 1
  ✓ Sent to client: /127.0.0.1:XXXXX
  Successfully sent to 1/1 clients
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

━━━ WebSocket Client: RECEIVED MESSAGE ━━━
Raw message: {"shopId":4,"ownerId":2,"shopName":"Pizza Palace","status":"approved","action":"status_changed"}
Parsed message: ShopStatusMessage{shopId=4, shopName='Pizza Palace', status='approved', action='status_changed'}
Notifying 3 listener(s)...
✓ Notified 3 listener(s) successfully

━━━ ShopsController: RECEIVED shop status change ━━━
Shop ID: 4
Shop Name: Pizza Palace
New Status: approved
Action: status_changed
Clearing and reloading shops...
ShopsController: Loading 3 approved shops
  - Khan Kitchen (ID: 2, Status: approved)
  - Sushi World (ID: 3, Status: approved)
  - Pizza Palace (ID: 4, Status: approved)  ← NEW SHOP!
Shops reload complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Expected UI Behavior:**
- ✅ **Pizza Palace should INSTANTLY appear** in Shops list
- ✅ **Food items from Pizza Palace** should appear in Menu page
- ✅ **Food items from Pizza Palace** should appear in Food Items page
- ✅ **NO PAGE REFRESH NEEDED!**

### **STEP 6: Test Shop Rejection (Approved → Rejected)**
1. In **Admin Panel**: Find an **approved** shop (e.g., "Sushi World")
2. Change dropdown to **"rejected"**
3. Click **"Details"** button

**Expected Console Output:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ BROADCASTING SHOP STATUS CHANGE                        ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
  Shop ID:     3
  Shop Name:   Sushi World
  New Status:  rejected
  Connected clients (before broadcast): 1
  ✓ Sent to client: /127.0.0.1:XXXXX
  Successfully sent to 1/1 clients
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

━━━ WebSocket Client: RECEIVED MESSAGE ━━━
Raw message: {"shopId":3,"ownerId":3,"shopName":"Sushi World","status":"rejected","action":"status_changed"}
Parsed message: ShopStatusMessage{shopId=3, shopName='Sushi World', status='rejected', action='status_changed'}
Notifying 3 listener(s)...
✓ Notified 3 listener(s) successfully

━━━ ShopsController: RECEIVED shop status change ━━━
Shop ID: 3
Shop Name: Sushi World
New Status: rejected
Action: status_changed
Clearing and reloading shops...
ShopsController: Loading 1 approved shops
  - Khan Kitchen (ID: 2, Status: approved)
Shops reload complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Expected UI Behavior:**
- ✅ **Sushi World should INSTANTLY disappear** from Shops list
- ✅ **Food items from Sushi World** should disappear from Menu page
- ✅ **Food items from Sushi World** should disappear from Food Items page
- ✅ **NO PAGE REFRESH NEEDED!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Connected clients: 0"**
**Cause:** User panel not open or not on correct page

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Open user panel and navigate to Shops page
2. ✅ Check for "Shop Status WebSocket: Total clients: 1"
3. ✅ Restart app if needed

### **Problem: No broadcast when clicking "Details"**
**Cause:** Admin not clicking "Details" button after changing dropdown

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Change dropdown (approved/rejected)
2. ✅ **CLICK "Details" button** (⚠️ Critical step!)

### **Problem: Shop doesn't appear/disappear**
**Cause:** Shop status filter not working correctly

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Check database for correct shop status
2. ✅ Verify `getApprovedShops()` query includes status filter
3. ✅ Check UI reload logic

---

## 📊 Expected Database Behavior

### **Shop Status Changes:**
```sql
-- Before: Shop status = 'pending'
-- After admin approval: Shop status = 'approved'
-- After admin rejection: Shop status = 'rejected'
```

### **Shop Filtering:**
```sql
-- Only approved shops shown to users:
SELECT * FROM shops WHERE status = 'approved'
```

### **Food Item Filtering:**
```sql
-- Food items from approved shops only:
SELECT fi.* FROM food_items fi
JOIN shops s ON fi.shop_id = s.id
WHERE s.status = 'approved'
```
