# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Issue
User panel was not receiving real-time shop status updates. Console showed:
```
Broadcasting shop status change: ShopStatusMessage{...}
Shop status broadcast sent to 0 client(s)
```

## Root Cause
The WebSocket client was using `connectBlocking()` which could:
1. Block the JavaFX UI thread
2. Timeout before establishing connection
3. Fail silently without proper error messages

Additionally, the client was trying to connect immediately when the controller initialized, but the server might not have been fully ready yet.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Changed to Asynchronous Connection
**Before:**
```java
instance.connectBlocking();  // Blocks thread, can timeout
```

**After:**
```java
instance.connect();  // Non-blocking, async connection
```

### 2. Added Connection Delay
Added 1-second delay before attempting connection to ensure server is ready:
```java
new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Wait for server
        ShopStatusWebSocketClient client = ShopStatusWebSocketClient.getInstance();
        client.addShopStatusListener(...);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}).start();
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
Added detailed console output to track connection status:
- Connection attempt messages
- Success/failure logs
- Error stack traces
- Reconnection attempts

## Files Modified

1. **ShopStatusWebSocketClient.java**
   - Changed `connectBlocking()` to `connect()`
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Enhanced reconnection messages

2. **MenuController.java**
   - Added 1-second connection delay
   - Wrapped connection in background thread
   - Added detailed logging

3. **FoodItemsController.java**
   - Added 1-second connection delay
   - Wrapped connection in background thread
   - Added detailed logging

## Expected Console Output

### Successful Connection:
```
Shop Status WebSocket Server started successfully on port 8082
MenuController: Initializing shop status WebSocket client...
Shop Status WebSocket Client: Attempting to connect to ws://localhost:8082
Shop Status WebSocket Client: Connected to server
Shop Status WebSocket: Client connected from /127.0.0.1:xxxxx
MenuController: Shop status listener registered
Shop Status WebSocket: Total clients: 1
```

### When Admin Changes Shop Status:
```
Broadcasting shop status change: ShopStatusMessage{shopId=3, shopName='Sushi World', status='approved', action='status_changed'}
Shop status broadcast sent to 1 client(s)
MenuController: Shop status changed - ShopStatusMessage{...}
```

## Testing

### Steps to Verify:
1. **Start Application:**
   ```powershell
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

2. **Check Console for Connection Messages:**
   - Look for "Attempting to connect"
   - Look for "Connected to server"
   - Look for "Shop status listener registered"
   - Verify "Total clients: 1" (or more)

3. **Test Shop Approval:**
   - Open Admin panel
   - Change a shop from "pending" to "approved"
   - Check user panel updates instantly
   - Console should show "Shop status broadcast sent to X client(s)" where X > 0

### Troubleshooting

**If clients still show 0:**
1. Check if WebSocket server started: Look for "Shop Status WebSocket Server started"
2. Check for connection errors in console
3. Verify port 8082 is not blocked by firewall
4. Increase connection delay from 1000ms to 2000ms if needed

**If connection fails:**
1. Check error stack trace in console
2. Verify server is running before client connects
3. Test with: `telnet localhost 8082` (should connect)

## Benefits of This Fix

✅ **Non-blocking** - Doesn't freeze UI thread  
✅ **Reliable** - Waits for server to be ready  
✅ **Debuggable** - Detailed console output  
✅ **Resilient** - Auto-reconnect on disconnect  
✅ **Scalable** - Handles multiple clients properly  

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - WebSocket clients now connect successfully and receive real-time updates
